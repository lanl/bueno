# bueno: Automated, Reproducible Benchmarking and Analysis

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/lanl/bueno.svg?branch=master)
](https://travis-ci.com/lanl/bueno)

System benchmarking provides a means to compare or assess the performance of
hardware or software against a point of reference. Because of the multitude of
factors that ultimately influence a benchmarkâ€™s results, reproducibility is
challenging. To aid in this, we present an extensible software framework named
bueno that provides mechanisms to record and automate many arduous, error-prone
benchmarking tasks: environmental discovery, environmental setup, program
compilation, program execution, data storage, and analysis. More on this later.

## Installation

### User Installation With pip
In a terminal perform the following (assumes a bash-like shell).
```
cd bueno # The directory in which setup.py is located.
python3 -m pip install --user .
```
Add bueno's installation prefix to `PATH`.
```
export PY_USER_BIN=$(python3 -c 'import site; print(site.USER_BASE + "/bin")')
export PATH=$PY_USER_BIN:$PATH
```
Now, the `bueno` command should be available for use.

### User Uninstallation with pip
```
python3 -m pip uninstall bueno
```

## Quick Start
After installation, here are some quick examples for getting started. 
The following is the "hello world" equivalent of a bueno run script. 
This is a simplified version of the example described in more detail 
[here](https://lanl.github.io/bueno/html/bueno-run-getting-started.html).
```
# hello.py
from bueno.public import experiment
from bueno.public import logger

def main(argv):
    experiment.name('hello-word')
    logger.log('hello world')
```
Which is executed by:
```
$ bueno run -a none -p hello.py
```

Now, this script can be directly expanded to include more important actions,
or with just a few lines, bueno can call an existing program file.
```
# hello.py
from bueno.public import experiment
from bueno.public import host

def main(argv):
    experiment.name('call-bye')
    # call the other file by passing a terminal command
    host.run('python3 goodbye.py')
```
Where goodbye.py is another python script in the same directory as hello.py
and again executed the same way.

There are additional parameters that can be passed for greater detail when 
debugging outlined at the implementation of bueno.public.host.run
