bueno
#####

*bueno* is a Python framework enabled by container technology that supports
gradations of reproducibility for *well-provenanced* benchmarking of sequential
and parallel programs.  The ultimate goal of the bueno project is to provide
convenient access to mechanisms that aid in the automated generation,
collection, and dissemination of data relevant for experimental reproducibility
in computer system benchmarking.
